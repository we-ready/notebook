THE ARTIST

Long, long ago there lived a king. He loved horses. One day he asked an artist to draw him a beautiful horse. The artist said, "All right, but you must wait." So the king waited. He waited and waited. At last, after a year he could not wait any longer. He went to see the artist himself.  

Quickly the artist brought paper and a brush. In five minutes he finished drawing a very beautiful horse. The king was angry. "You can draw a good horse in five minutes, yet you kept me waiting for a year. Why?"  
 
"Come with me, please", said the artist. They went to the artists' workroom. There the king saw piles and piles of paper. On every piece of paper was a picture of a horse." It took me more than a year to learn to draw a beautiful horse in five minutes", the artist said.

## TEXT

"THE MOVING BLACKBOARD"
 
More than one hundred years ago there was a great French scientist with the name Ampere.  

One day, Mr Ampere went out for a walk in the street. There were a lot of people and much noise there. But all this was nothing to him. He was thinking about a maths problem. He had no paper with him. How could he work it out?  

Just then, he saw a blackboard in front of him. He ran up to it at once. He took out a piece of chalk and wrote his problem on the blackboard. Then he started to work on it. The blackboard moved a little, but he did not notice it. The blackboard moved on. Mr Apere moved with it. The blackboard started to move away faster and faster. Mr Ampere could not keep up with it any longer. He stopped to have a look.  

What did he see? Why, the "blackboard" was NOT a blackboard. It was the back of a carriage!

Son: I know it's far away from the earth.

Son: They didn't find any living things there, did they?  
Father: No, they didn't. It's too hot in the day and too cold at night. And there's no air or water there. Nothing can live on the moon.  
Son: I hear walking on the moon is more difficult. It's like jumping and flying. Is that so?  
Father: Yes, isn't that interesting! Everything is much lighter on the moon. You can jump much higher on the moon than on the earth.

A WAY OUT

A French student went to London for his holiday. He thought: "I know a little English. I think people can understand me".  

One morning he went to visit the Science Museum. At noon he was tired and hungry. He went to the nearest restaurant and sat down at the table. He wanted to have a cup of tea and some eggs. Soon the waiter came up to him and asked, "Can I help you, sir?"  

"A cup of tea and," he could not remember the English word for eggs. He looked around him, but nobody was eating eggs.  

Then he saw a magazine on the table next to him. There was a picture of a cock on its cover. He showed the picture to the waiter.

## TEXT

TWO FRIENDS AND A BEAR

One day two young men were going through the forest. One said to the other, "We're good friends. We must help each other. If any beast comes at you, I'll stay with you and help you." The other friend said, "I will help you too, if any beast comes at you".  

They walked on.  

After a while there was a great noise. It was a big bear. The young men ran away quickly. One of them got up into a tree. But the other was fat and could not climb up. So he threw himself at the foot of the tree. He thought to himself, "The bear will think that I am dead."  

Soon the bear came near. The bear looked at the fat young man, then it put its nose down and smelled him. The young man held his breath. The bear thought he was dead, so it went away.  
The man in the tree came down. With a smile he asked his friend, "The bear put its mouth so near to your ear. What did it say to you?"  

The friend answered, "The bear said, Don't trust your friend. He ran away from you when you needed his help most. Remember: A friend in need is a friend indeed."

LENIN AND THE GUARD

One morning Lenin was going to his office. At the gate a guard stopped him.  
"Your pass, please".  
"Oh, yes, my pass", said Lenin. "It's in one of my pockets". He began to look for it in his pockets.  

Just then a young man came up. This young man knew Lenin. He said to the guard: "Let  him in."  
"No, I won't let him in if he has no pass. What's more, I want to see your pass, too".  

The young man became angry. "This is Comrade Lenin. Let him in, I tell you!" he shouted at the guard.  
"Don't shout at him," Lenin told the young man. "He's right. We must obey the rules!"  
Lenin found his pass and showed it to the guard. The guard looked at it carefully.  Yes, it was Lenin himself.  
 
"I'm sorry." The guard said and his face turned red. "I didn't know it was you."  
"But you did the right thing," Lenin said. "You are a good comrade. You are strict in your work. We must all be strict in our work".

THE STORY OF LITTLE GAUSS

One afternoon some boys made a lot of noise in class. The teacher got angry.
He kept them in the classroom after school. He told them to add all the numbers from 1 to 100 together.  
 
The boys took out their exercise-books. All of them began to write the numbers down except one boy. He was new in the school. He looked out of the window for a few minutes. Then he wrote a number in his exercise-book and put up his hand.  
"May I go home, sir?" he asked. "Iknow the answer now".  

The teacher and the other boys were very surprised.  
"Bring it here." said the teacher.  
The boy took it to the teacher. The answer was right, so the teacher had to let the boy go home. 

The next morning, the teacher asked the boy, "How did you find the answer so quickly?"  
"Well, sir," he said, "I didn't want to stay here long. So I tried my best to find the answer quickly. Soon I found it. You see, if you add 100 to 1, you get 101, and 99 and 2 is 101. 98 and 3 is 101 too, and when you reach 51 and 50, you have 101 fifty times. That is 5050".  

After this, when the teacher gave the class exercises to do, he gave this boy different exercises. The boy's name was Karl F. Gauss. When he grew up, he became a great scientist.
