#### 荣誉

```
荣誉不属于那些批评家：那些指出强者如何跌倒或者实干家哪里可以做得更好的人。荣誉属于真正在竞技场上拼搏的人，属于脸庞沾满灰尘、汗水和鲜血的人，属于顽强奋斗的人，属于屡败屡战但还拥有巨大热情和奉献精神的人，因为没有努力是没有错误或缺点的；荣誉属于投身于有价值的事业的人，属于敢于追求伟大梦想，最终取得伟大成就或者虽败犹荣的人。这样，他的位置，将永远不会和那些灵魂冷漠胆小而不知胜败的人在一起。
```
```
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
